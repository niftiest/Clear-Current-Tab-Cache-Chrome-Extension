Clear Current Tab Cache

## Short Description (132 characters max)
One-click cache clearing for the current site only. No settings, no popups asking for confirmation—just click and clear.

## Detailed Description

**Clear cache for just the current website with a single click.**

Tired of clearing your entire browser cache just to fix one broken site? Clear Current Tab Cache does exactly what the name says—it clears the cached data for only the site you're currently viewing, leaving everything else untouched.

**How it works:**
1. Navigate to any website
2. Click the extension icon
3. Done! Cache cleared for that site only

**Features:**
- Single-click operation—no confirmation dialogs or settings to configure
- Clears cache for the current domain only, not your entire browser
- Visual confirmation shows exactly which site was cleared
- Lightweight and fast—no background processes running

**Perfect for:**
- Web developers testing changes
- Troubleshooting website display issues
- Fixing broken or outdated cached content
- Anyone who wants quick, targeted cache clearing

**Privacy:**
This extension only accesses the current tab's URL to determine which domain's cache to clear. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
